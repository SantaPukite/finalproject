This project was done with the idea of a website for a restaurant.

These are the steps I did:
1. Coming up with an idea. 
2. What functionalities website could have?
    - ordering (from menu and by filling out the order form);
    - going from page to page (main and order).
3. Including the bootstrap* CSS link
4. Creating the main page:
    - basic structure with **!DOCTYPE html**, **html**, **head**, **body** tags;
    - head section includes meta tags, bootstrap CSS link, and custom CSS;
    - body section;
    - navbar for links from one page to another;
    - cookies container;
    - jumbotron (learned on my own time from online video);
    - menu utilises already provided bootstrap cards;
    - footer.
5. Creating the order page:
    - basic structure similar to the main page;
    - head section includes meta tags, bootstrap CSS link, and custom CSS;
    - body section;
    - navbar (again the same as the main page);
    - cookies;
    - jumbotron;
    - order form;
    - order confirmation that shows only after submission;
    - footer.
6. Added JS for more interactivity like cookies container goes away after clicking the “Accept”, and for approval after submission.
7. Styling with custom CSS just because I wanted to add more skills to the project.
8. Pictures were manipulated with Photoshop.

*chosen from previous knowledge and another course about web applications.
